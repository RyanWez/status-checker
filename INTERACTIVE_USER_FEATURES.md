## Callback Query Patterns

The system uses structured callback data for navigation:

```python
# Pagination
"users_page_0"          # Go to page 0
"users_page_1"          # Go to page 1

# User actions
"user_info_123456789"   # Show user details
"user_delete_confirm_123456789"  # Confirm deletion
"user_delete_123456789" # Actually delete user
"user_change_role_123456789"     # Show role menu

# Role changes
"set_role_123456789_admin"  # Set user to admin
"set_role_123456789_user"   # Set user to user
"set_role_123456789_guest"  # Set user to guest
```
